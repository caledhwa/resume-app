# Jim Lawson - Resume

## About

This is a React application created to showcase my React, JS, and CSS coding skills in the form of a resume.

The resume is a single-page, static web application with the option print to two, 8.5 x 11 pages.

Start the application on localhost to view as a web page. Click on the link in the header to load a printable version and then print to a printer or, preferably, to a PDF so that one may follow http links embedded in the document.
